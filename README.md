This is a Vue starter template designed to kickstart your Vue projects with a strong foundation of tools and
configurations that improve development workflow, code quality, and application performance. The template integrates
Vite for bundling and development, Tailwind CSS for styling, and TypeScript for type checking, among others.

- **TypeScript**: A strict syntactical superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing.
